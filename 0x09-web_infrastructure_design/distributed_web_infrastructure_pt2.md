# Web infrastructure design

## 1. Distributed web infrastructure

### Issues with this infrastructure

- **SPOF (Single Point Of Failure).** <br />
    Failure of the server causes whole network to collapse

- **Security issues.** <br />
    Prone to malware and interception by third parties to gather data passed between the two systems (no firewall, no HTTPS).
- **No monitoring.** <br />

    You cannot assess the health and performance of your servers in real-time.
